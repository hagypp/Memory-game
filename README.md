The memory game is a fun and challenging activity that can improve your ability to remember and recall information. It's often played as a party game or a brain-training exercise, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over two cards. If the two cards have the same number, 
then they keep the cards, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.
